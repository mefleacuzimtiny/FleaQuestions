FleaQuestions is meant to be a collection of simple scripts that I made to help me not waste time thinking of
random questions when I'm practicing the methods taught to me by my teachers at uni.
Each script can run independently without any particular dependencies so long as you have python installed.
It only imports "random" from the python standard library

This readme is just here for the sake of it.
